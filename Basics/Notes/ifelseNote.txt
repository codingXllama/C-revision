 you have more than one statement under if or else (or any other block in C like a loop), then you need to put the code within {},
but if you have only one statement then the parenthesis is just option in all cases.


Example 1: 
if (condition1){   // this is mandatory as we have multiple statements (2 statements)
    statement1;
    statement2;  
}
else{    // mandatory as we have 2 statements
    statement1;
    statement2;      
}
 
Example 2: 
if (condition1){   // this is NOT mandatory as we have multiple 1 statement, just optional
    statement1; 
}
else{    // NOT mandatory as we have 1 statement, just optional
    statement1;      
}
 
Example 3:
if (condition1){   // this is mandatory as we have multiple statements (2 statements)
    statement1;
    statement2;  
}
else    // NOT mandatory as we have single statement, you may provide {} as well
    statement1;
 
Example 4:
if (condition1)   // here NOT mandatory as we have multiple single statement, you may provide as well
    statement1; 
else{    // mandatory as we have 2 statements
    statement1;
    statement2;      
}
